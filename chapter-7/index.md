## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithms considers weights on the edges. The edges or paths between nodes have weights.

Where as breadth-first search considers the edges to be of equal weight. Resulting in the fewest number of edges.

Four Steps:
1. find the cheapest node
2. update the cost of the neighbors
3. repeat until this has been done for every node in the graph
4. calculate the final path
