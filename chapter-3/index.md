# Notes

Recurssion can make some alorithms easier to implement. However it generally doesn't offer an performance advantage over iterative solutions.

Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

There are common pitfalls with recurssion, such as accidentally creating an infinite loop.

# 3.1

The greet function calls the greet2 function with the parameter of maggie. After the execution of Greet2 it will return to the original greet function.

# 3.2

The call stack will eventually run out of memory. The program will most likely be ended by the operating system.
